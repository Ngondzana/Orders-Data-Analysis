# Orders-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on the analysis of orders data obtained from the Kaggle API. The objective is to derive insights regarding product revenue, sales performance across regions, month-over-month growth, and category performance. The cleaned DataFrame was then uploaded to a Microsoft SQL Server database for further analysis and querying.
